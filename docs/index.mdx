The knowledge base is a collection of articles written by the community. It's a place to share your knowledge and learn from others. The following categories exist to group content:

- [Design](/knowledge/design/) - Guides/articles covering design-related topics.
- [Development](/knowledge/development/) - Guides/articles covering development-related topics.
- [Component Library](/knowledge/component-library/) - Sharing custom components for Docusaurus.
- [Hosting](/knowledge/hosting/) - Guides/articles covering hosting-related topics.

## How to contribute

If you want to contribute to the knowledge base, you can do so by creating a pull request on the [website repository](https://github.com/homotechsual/docusaurus.community). The knowledge base is a collection of Markdown files, so you can create a new file or edit an existing one.
